**Setting up the virtual environment**

We will create the virtual environment to make sure that we have all the required version of the packages for running the code without errors.
To create a virtual environment, decide upon a directory where you want to place it, and run the venv module as a script with the directory path:

```
python3 -m venv your_venv_name
```

Once youâ€™ve created a virtual environment, you may activate it.

On Windows, run:

```
your_venv_name\Scripts\activate.bat
```

On Unix or MacOS, run:

```
source your_venv_name/bin/activate
```
**Installation of dependencies**

Before running anything after cloning the repository, please make sure to install the required packages using command:

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
**Run the application**
```
python manage.py runserver
```
